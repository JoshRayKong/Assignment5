      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>According to local folklore, the barrio of Malutac in Dumangas was famous for its well-bred horses. There was once a horse called Tamasak, a pure white stallion in the stead of one Don Simon Protacio. Don Protacio was offered to sell the horse to Manuel Gonzales de Aguilar, the governor-general of the Philippines at that time whose white horse previously died. Don Protacio adamantly refused to sell his horse which led to Gonzales de Aguilar personally visiting Don Protacio's compound in order to persuade him to do so. After a long negotiation, they came to a truce wherein Tamasak will be given to the governor-general in exchange for Malutac to be made into a town. When the barrio was eventually separated from Dumangas and became a town, it was renamed into Barotac Nuevo.

        The name "Barotac" is from the Spanish word "baro", which means mud, as well as the second syllables of the Hiligaynon word, "lutac" which also means mud. "Nuevo", which translates to new, was added to the name to distinguish it from another town called Barotac Viejo located 26 kilometres (16 mi) north.
        
        Barotac Nuevo is a small town whose main industry and capital are in fishing and agriculture. The town church was built by Spanish Roman Catholic missionaries in the 16th century.    </div>
